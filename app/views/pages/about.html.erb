          For a long time, I was engaged in the development and implementation of technical solutions for security systems.
          We worked with large facilities, such as stadiums, airports, large shopping centers and entertainment complexes.
          The systems were both self-contained and integrated with other engineering systems or with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of greatest interest were integrated security complexes,
          where several systems complementing each other became a single multifunctional system.
          To do this, it was necessary to manage various events of systems and store information about these events.
          So I got acquainted with programming (JavaScript, VisualBasic) and databases.
          Gradually I trained my skills, I took part in the development of an automatic system for fixing traffic violations,
          developed a template for calculating engineering solutions.

          In connection with the beginning of the ATO in the eastern region, where I lived and worked, the projects were closed.
          In the market of engineering solutions of Ukraine, there was a crisis, and I needed to change my occupation.
          I chose to job as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          First I got acquainted with Python Django, after a while I got carried away with programming in PHP,
          and later I mastered Ruby on Rails. The software developer has been working for the last 2 years,
          and I like to create new software solutions.

          Now I'm looking for opportunities to apply existing skills and further professional growth.
